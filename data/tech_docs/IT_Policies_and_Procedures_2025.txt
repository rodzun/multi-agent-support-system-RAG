Defines the mandated process for developing, testing, and deploying all proprietary software.
- **Code Repository:** GitHub Enterprise is the mandated repository. All commits must be signed and associated with a valid Jira ticket number.
- **Branching Strategy:** The GitFlow branching model is mandatory (main, develop, feature, hotfix). Direct commits to the `main` or `release` branches are strictly prohibited.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** All code deployments must run through the automated GitLab CI/CD pipeline, including unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis (SAST) before merging to the `develop` branch.

## 14. Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST)
Ensuring security is built into the development process (DevSecOps).
- **SAST Integration:** Static Code Analysis (using SonarQube) is run automatically on every Pull Request (PR). PRs with critical vulnerabilities (CVSS score > 7.0) will be automatically blocked from merging.
- **DAST Scanning:** Dynamic Application Security Testing is run nightly against the Staging environment to identify runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection). Identified High-risk findings must be triaged within 24 hours.
- **Vulnerability Remediation SLA:** Critical vulnerabilities must be patched and deployed within 7 calendar days. High severity within 15 days.

## 15. Change Management Policy (CM)
All changes to production environments must follow a formal, documented process.

- **Failover:** Production services are configured for active-passive failover between AWS regions (US-East-1 and US-West-2). The failover drill is performed quarterly and documented.
- **Data Integrity:** Database backups are tested monthly by performing a restoration to a non-production environment to verify data integrity and restoration procedures.

## 17. Patch and Vulnerability Management
Policies governing the timely application of security updates.
- **Critical Patches:** OS and application patches addressing Critical vulnerabilities (e.g., zero-day exploits) must be applied within **48 hours** across all non-production environments and within **72 hours** in Production.
- **Standard Patches:** Non-critical patches are deployed during the monthly maintenance window (the third Saturday of every month, 1:00 AM – 5:00 AM UTC).
- **Scanning:** All servers and network devices are scanned weekly using Tenable Nessus, with reports automatically routed to the Security Operations Center (SOC).

## 18. Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting
Ensuring comprehensive observability for rapid incident detection.
- **Logging Standard:** All applications and infrastructure components must log events to the centralized **Splunk** cluster. Logs must adhere to the standardized JSON format.
- **Metric Collection:** Performance metrics (CPU, latency, error rates) are collected using **Datadog**. Custom business metrics are mandatory for all new features.
- **Alert Tiers:** P1 (System Down) alerts automatically trigger PagerDuty notifications to the on-call engineer, requiring acknowledgment within 5 minutes. P2 alerts generate an immediate Jira ticket for the appropriate team.

## 19. Data Handling and Classification
Defines procedures for handling different types of organizational data.
- **Data Tiers:** Data is classified as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted (e.g., PII/PCI/PHI). Restricted data must only reside in encrypted storage volumes and never on employee local hard drives.
- **Encryption:** All data at rest (databases, storage buckets) and data in transit (VPN, TLS 1.2 or higher) must be encrypted using approved AES-256 standards.
- **Retention:** Customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) must be purged from databases 7 years after the contract termination date, as per compliance mandates.

## 20. Acceptable Use of Collaboration Tools
Specific guidelines for using tools like Slack, Teams, and shared drives.
- **External Sharing:** Sharing confidential data via external links (OneDrive/Google Drive external shares) is prohibited. Internal sharing must use security groups.
- **Ephemeral Messaging:** While ephemeral messaging (Slack) is allowed, conversations regarding critical business decisions, financial transactions, or legal issues must be conducted via email for record-keeping purposes.
- **Storage Limits:** Shared drives (SharePoint) have a maximum folder size of 5 TB. Users exceeding this limit will be notified by IT to archive old data.

## 21. Database Security and Access Control
Access to database systems must follow strict authentication and authorization protocols.
- **Service Accounts:** Direct application access to databases must use dedicated, least-privileged service accounts, not generic credentials. Passwords for these accounts are rotated automatically every 30 days via a vault.
- **DBA Access:** Database Administrator (DBA) access to production data is granted only via encrypted SSH tunnels and requires pre-approval for the duration of the required task (Just-In-Time Access).
- **Encryption:** All sensitive columns (PII, financial data) must be encrypted at the column level within the database, in addition to disk-level encryption.

## 22. Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
All infrastructure provisioning and configuration must be managed through code.

- **State Files:** Terraform state files must be stored remotely in a secured S3 bucket (or equivalent) with versioning and encryption enabled. Direct manipulation of state files is prohibited.
- **Code Review:** All changes to IaC (Terraform modules, Ansible playbooks) must go through mandatory peer review and approval on GitHub before merging to the main branch.

## 23. Release Management and Deployment Strategies
Defines the approved methods for deploying code to production with minimal downtime.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Blue/Green or Canary deployment strategies are mandatory for all core services to minimize risk. Rolling updates are allowed only for minor, non-critical services.
- **Gating:** A dedicated Quality Assurance (QA) engineer must provide a formal sign-off (a "gate") in the CI/CD pipeline before any deployment can proceed to the Production environment.
- **Load Testing:** All major releases (those including new features or significant architectural changes) must undergo load testing in the Staging environment to simulate 150% of peak production traffic.

## 24. End-of-Life (EoL) and Obsolescence Policy
Manages the removal of outdated hardware, software, and services.
- **EoL Review:** IT performs a quarterly review of all production software dependencies to identify components approaching End-of-Life (EoL).
- **Remediation SLA:** Software identified as EoL (no longer receiving security patches) must be upgraded or decommissioned within 90 days. Critical EoL components require immediate plan submission to the CTO.
- **Hardware Disposal:** All retired hardware (laptops, servers) must undergo a three-pass physical data wipe or degaussing before being disposed of by a certified electronics recycling vendor.

## 25. Third-Party Vendor Security Assessment
Governs the security review of external software providers.

- **Access Management:** Vendor access to internal systems must be granted via time-limited, segregated accounts and must be revoked immediately upon contract termination.
- **Compliance Documentation:** Vendors handling restricted data (PII, financial) must provide SOC 2 Type II reports, ISO 27001 certification, or equivalent documentation annually.

## 26. Security Auditing and Penetration Testing
Periodic validation of the security posture against external threats.
- **External Pen Testing:** A full external penetration test must be conducted annually by an independent third-party vendor on all public-facing applications and network perimeters.
- **Internal Audit:** Internal audits targeting specific high-risk areas (e.g., cloud configuration, firewall rules) are performed semi-annually.
- **Remediation Tracking:** All findings from penetration tests are logged as high-priority tickets in Jira, with a mandatory deadline for completion set by the CISO.

## 27. Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
Systems deployed to actively watch for and alert on malicious activity.
- **IDS Deployment:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS/IPS) are deployed at the network perimeter and internal choke points to monitor for known attack signatures and anomalous behavior.
- **Alert Triage:** All high-severity IDS alerts are funneled directly to the 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) team for immediate triage and response. The false positive rate target is below 5%.
